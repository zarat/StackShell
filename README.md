# StackShell

Create your own scripting language or extend a project with scripting capabilities.

To build one of the projects yourself download [ScriptStack](https://github.com/zarat/ScriptStack) or get it via [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScriptStack/), add a reference to each project and build it. 

For examples take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/zarat/StackShell/wiki/Examples).
